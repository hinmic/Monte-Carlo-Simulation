# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
This project simulates the outcome of firing a cannonball to a castle. The cannonball is fired with random data limited by a particular range. If the cannonball can pass the distance check and height check, and at the same time within 5 meters measured vertical from the cliff face, it is determined a successful trial.
